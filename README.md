## Goal: Create a platform for high school students to post their solutions to math textbook questions or challenging math problems and have other students provide feedback and comment on them 

## [*PEER PROOF* Website](https://calmcarrot76.qoom.space/Peer_Proof/index.html)
## [*PEER PROOF* GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TTS-BJMV/PEER_PROOF)

Our project is a website that allows high school students to improve their mathematical communication skills. 

### Students can ...
* Post their detailed solutions to textbook questions or problem solving questions for peers to comment on
* Provide helpful feedback and ask questions about other students' solutions
* Gain access to quizzes, articles and other learning resources posted by other students to practice technical math skills alongside communication skills
* _"5-Star"_ other students' comments to encourage constructive, critical feedback to each other's solutions 
* Rate other student's solutions and see how well-communicated others find their solutions

### The Motivation Behind This Project

It is easy for students to become so focused on finding the right answer to a math problem that they completely neglect the presentation of solution. Oftentimes, an elegantly communicated solution is just as, if not more, important than the final answer. 

To encourage the clear communication of students' problem solving process, *PEER PROOF*'s learning platform puts an emphasis on the clarity, concision, and elegance of written solutions. It does this through a student-teach-student learning model. Recieving and providing good criticism teaches students on both sides how they can improve the way they write their solutions to problems. 

The benefit of a student-based learning system is that students can point out each other's mistakes while reflecting on how those same mistakes appear in their own work. Sometimes seeing where other students get confused in your solution allows you to better understand where you may have made a mistake. 

To encourage healthy discussion and respectful criticism, students can rate the quality of comments on a _"5-Star"_ scale. Top rated comments will appear at the top of discussions for the students to read and reflect upon.

A variety of other studying tools, including a quiz web page and a Pomodoro timer, are added to the website to give students a one-stop experience for all their studying needs. We hope to foster an ideal learning environment for students to study efficiently while learning from each other.

*PEER PROOF* facilitates group discussion between students, providing a platform for students to make mistakes and learn from them together.

### How to Use PEER PROOF

#### Homepage
Located on the main page are 

#### Profile Page

#### Proofreading
You can post a problem and your solution in the appropriate category or post your solution to an already posted problem. Your solutions don't have to be complete. Sometimes, showing what you've got so far and getting feedback on it can help guide you to the right path!

Add comments to the posted solutions and highlight the sections that you are referring to. *PEER PROOF* keeps track of everytime you provide feedback, and you can __level up__ your "proofreading prowess" by giving enough good critics. Thumbs up other comments that you find constructive and they'll show up closer to the top.

#### Quiz Page
Quizzes, articles and other resources are located on the homepage. Click the links to be brought to those sites. 


#### Pomodoro Timer
Students learn best when they are given ample time in between study session to relax and subconsciously process the information. Our built-in **Pomodoro Timer** will help keep track of how long you've been studying for and remind you when it's time to take a break.

### Challenges We Encountered
This was the first hackathon for all our group members. Picking a project that was both within our coding capabilities as well as ambitious and innovative was a difficult first step. Different timezone- internation team A big idea and we couldn't make every single aspect of it but we made a great project with the skills we had and it turning really pretty

___

### Our Proud Accomplishments
I'm sure they're coming too... ('3') \[Integration of Proofreading and Quizzing into a single platform along with a pomodoro timer which improves efficiency of the user\]
Beautiful website design- visually appealing to user. Easy to navigate, very clean. First hackathon, made a complete project (got the work we set out to do finished)
___

### What We've Learned
Teamwork, website design and how to that. Learned about design process: brainstorming, planning, and building. 

___

### Future Project Extensions
Currently, this platform has focused its scope on mathematics; however, the same system can encourage strong communication skills in other subjects as well. More advanced features could include providing an easy way for users to add mathematical symbols and notations when typing out their solutions and adding pictures or screenshots of their work that can also be highlighted. (Adding more javascript to make the website function how we planned, creating database, containing user responses and post, make buttons work explore backend, linking profile and account with google account,)
